<h1 align="center">Terminology</h1>


**Please familiarize yourself with the following terms. It really helps**


1. Operating System (OS):
 An operating system is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing services for computer programs and controlling the execution of programs. It acts as an intermediary between applications and hardware.

2. Kernel:
 The kernel is the core component of an operating system. It provides essential services like process management, memory management, device drivers, and system calls. It runs in privileged mode and directly interacts with the hardware.

3. System Call:
 A system call is an interface provided by the operating system that allows user-level programs to request services from the kernel. Common system calls include creating a new process, reading/writing files, and allocating memory.

4. Device Driver:
A device driver is a software component that enables communication between the operating system and hardware devices, such as printers, network cards, or graphics cards.

5. Interrupt:
 An interrupt is a signal sent to the processor to notify it of an event that requires immediate attention, such as an I/O completion or hardware error. Interrupts allow the processor to respond to external events asynchronously.

6. Assembly Language:
Assembly language is a low-level programming language that represents instructions in human-readable mnemonic codes corresponding to machine instructions. It provides a direct way to interact with the hardware and is often used in OS development.

7. Memory Management Unit (MMU):
The MMU is a hardware component responsible for translating virtual addresses used by processes into physical addresses in RAM. It allows efficient memory utilization and protection between processes.

8. Pointer:
 A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. In C, pointers are commonly used for dynamic memory allocation and accessing data indirectly.

9. Stack:
 The stack is a region of memory used to store function call information, local variables, and return addresses. It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and is crucial for function calls and context switching.

10. Heap:
The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. Unlike the stack, it allows non-linear allocation and deallocation of memory, controlled explicitly by the programmer.

11. Cache:
Cache is a fast and small memory area located on the processor chip. It stores frequently accessed data to reduce the time taken to access data from main memory, improving performance.

12. Process:
Description:instance of a running program. It includes its own memory space, code, data, and system resources. The OS manages processes to achieve multitasking.

13. Multithreading:
 Multithreading is a programming technique where multiple threads within the same process execute concurrently. Threads share the same memory space, enabling efficient parallel processing.

14. Synchronization:
Synchronization is the coordination of multiple threads or processes to avoid data race and ensure orderly access to shared resources. Techniques like locks, semaphores, and mutexes are used for synchronization.

15. Deadlock:
Deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource, resulting in a standstill.

*These are some fundamental terms related to operating system development, low-level coding, and the C programming language. Familiarity with these concepts is crucial for understanding and working on low-level systems programming and OS development. These where generated by ChatGPT and are probably going to change in the future.*
