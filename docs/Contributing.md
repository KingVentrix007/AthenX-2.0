<h3 align="center">Guidelines Concerning Format:</h3>



1. at the top of your source file, specify if you will be using camelCase or snake_case.

2. Proper function names should Always be used. e.g for a function that read from a disk: int disk_read() instead of int my_function.

3. Variables: Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, avoiding single-letter names unless they have a specific purpose (e.g., loop counters).

4. Comments: Include clear and concise comments to explain complex logic, algorithms, or any non-obvious parts of the code. Avoid unnecessary comments that merely restate the code.
5. Function/Method Length: Keep functions and methods short and focused on a single task. If a function becomes too long, consider refactoring it into smaller, more manageable functions.
6. Whitespace and Blank Lines: Use whitespace to improve code readability. Separate code blocks logically with blank lines to make the code easier to scan.
7. Imports: Order imports alphabetically and group them by type (standard library, third-party libraries, and project-specific modules).

8. Use of Version Control: Follow version control best practices, such as meaningful commit messages and branching strategies.

9. Code Modularity: Aim to make your code modular and reusable, following the principles of software design patterns.

10. Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation for the codebase, including API usage and any installation or setup instructions.

11. Remove Dead Code: Regularly clean up unused or commented-out code to keep the codebase clutter-free. (I am still getting to this)

<h3 align="center">Guidelines Concerning Behavior</h3>

This section is more for people i invite to contribute, but you should consider it for yourself. Its just good practice to follow these conventions

1. Respectful Communication: Always maintain a respectful and courteous tone in all communications. Be open to feedback and avoid personal attacks or offensive language.

2. Constructive Criticism: When providing feedback, focus on the code or idea, not the person. Offer constructive criticism and suggest improvements rather than just pointing out problems.

3. Collaboration: Work collaboratively with other contributors. Be willing to help others and engage in discussions to find the best solutions for the project.

4. Ask for Help: If you encounter difficulties, don't hesitate to ask for help. Whether it's about the project's codebase, the development process, or the project's goals, seeking guidance can save time and prevent misunderstandings.

5. Consensus Building: In cases of major decisions, strive to reach a consensus within the team. Avoid forcing changes that could be contentious without proper discussion and agreement.

6. Accepting Feedback Gracefully: Be open to feedback from other contributors and project maintainers. If your work undergoes review, take suggestions in a positive manner and be willing to make improvements.


<h3 align="center">Other Guidelines</h3>

1. Only use the english language

2. Try and explain your function as simply as possible, if you have to use specific language, make sure it is included in the [terminology](https://github.com/KingVentrix007/AthenX-2.0/blob/main/docs/Terminology.md) file.

3. It is recommended to only use code licensed under the [GNU General Public License Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). If your code is not licensed under this license, I **will not** accept it unless it dose something that i have absolutely no idea how to do myself. please read [Occasions when non GPLv3 code is used](https://github.com/KingVentrix007/AthenX-2.0/blob/main/OtherLicenses/NonGPLv3.md)
